### [Updating...] The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (Kaggle Competition as Deep Learning Homework)
Content and Data Website: [http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news] [kaggleLink]  

This project was implemented with limited exposure to Deep Learning Knowledge. A result of ~97% was acquired but with few reasonable trials. The work and steps of implementation will be improved soon.

### Other Implementations:
